## Getting Started
These instructions will get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on your Oculus Go.

## Installing
To get a copy of this project working properly on your local machine, follow these simple steps:

- Download the project folder.
- Open the project with Unity 2019.3.3f1.
- Ensure the platform is set to Android in Build Settings.
- Build the .apk, load it into an Oculus Go and test the experience to ensure everything works fine.


## Deployment

### On your phone
- Open the Oculus app on your phone
- Click your paired Oculus Go headset at the top
- Click More Settings > Developer Mode and then toggle Developer Mode ON
- Connect the Oculus Go to your computer
- Accept the RSA key request on the Oculus Go

### On your computer
If you are on Windows, you could check if these files have already been downloaded and installed
- [Android Platform tool](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools)

    - If you see a device ID show up in the output with “unauthorized” behind it, put your Oculus Go on and give permission
    - If you see a device ID show up with “device” behind it, you are good to go and ready for the next step
- If your Oculus Go is still not found on the terminal
    - Go to the INSTALLEDPATH of the Android Platform tool on your computer (usually, it is found in C:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\AppData\Local\Android\sdk\platform-tools or C:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\AndroidPlatformTools\Android\sdk\platform-tools) and check if adb.exe is there
